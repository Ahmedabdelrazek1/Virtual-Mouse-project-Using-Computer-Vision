## **Overview**
The **Virtual Mouse Project** is an innovative application leveraging computer vision and artificial intelligence to emulate a physical mouse using hand gestures. This project enables users to interact with their computer seamlessly, offering a touchless, intuitive, and accessible experience.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Detect and track hand landmarks using advanced computer vision algorithms.
- **Gesture-Based Control**:
  - Move the mouse cursor.
  - Perform left and right clicks.
  - Scroll and drag functionality.
- **Customizable Gestures**: Modify or extend gesture definitions as needed.
- **Optimized Performance**: Designed for smooth and real-time interactions using Mediapipe and OpenCV.
